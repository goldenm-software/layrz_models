# Freezed

This entity project is build with the `freezed` package, that is a code generator for immutable classes that allows you to write data classes with a syntax that's similar to `@immutable` classes using `@freezed`, but without the boilerplate.

## Command to execute Freeze

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
